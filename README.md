# SMS Spam Classification

A machine learning project to **predict whether an SMS is spam or not** using Naive Bayes. The project includes data cleaning, EDA, model training, and deployment via a Streamlit app.

---

## Project Workflow

1. Collected SMS dataset from Kaggle (ham & spam messages)
2. Cleaned and pre-processed data
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Trained and compared multiple ML models
5. Selected Naive Bayes for best performance
6. Built and deployed a Streamlit app for real-time predictions
